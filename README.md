## t2m
This is my own variant of the popular text2mindmap, cloned from http://github.com/tobloef/text2mindmap, with a lot of changes:
- Syntax highlighting - instead of editing plain text, you can edit proper lists!
- A simple sqlite-based php server for keeping mindmaps on the server
- Read-only mode - you can see somebody else editing the mindmap and get live updates.  Just share the read-only link and get going!

## Can I try?
- Sure! A latest version is deployed on https://mindtu.be/
